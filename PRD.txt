Sustainable Firefighter Monitoring System (SFMS)
1. Product Overview
1.1 Purpose

The Sustainable Firefighter Monitoring System (SFMS) is an IoT-based safety solution designed to continuously monitor a firefighter’s physical condition, movement, and location in real time, and present this data on a centralized web dashboard for commanders or monitoring personnel.

The system aims to:

Detect emergencies automatically (no movement, high temperature)

Allow manual SOS signaling

Track live location

Log historical data for analysis

Operate sustainably using battery and solar charging

1.2 Target Users

Firefighters (wearable device users)

Fire commanders / control room operators (web dashboard users)

Project evaluators / researchers

3. Device (Hardware + Firmware) Requirements
3.1 Hardware Components

ESP32 microcontroller (Wi-Fi enabled)

MPU-6050 (movement & fall detection)

DHT11 (ambient temperature)

Neo-6M GPS module

Push button (manual SOS)

Buzzer (local alert)

Status LEDs

Li-ion battery

Solar panel

TP4056 charging module

3.2 Device Functional Requirements
3.2.1 Sensor Data Acquisition

The device shall:

Read acceleration data from MPU-6050 at regular intervals

Read ambient temperature from DHT11

Read GPS latitude and longitude from Neo-6M

Monitor SOS button state continuously

3.2.2 Movement Detection Logic

The system shall calculate movement magnitude from accelerometer data

If no significant movement is detected for a predefined duration (e.g., 30–60 seconds), the system shall classify the state as WARNING

If inactivity persists beyond a critical threshold, the system shall classify the state as EMERGENCY

3.2.3 Temperature Monitoring Logic

The system shall compare measured temperature against a predefined safe threshold

If temperature exceeds the threshold:

State shall change to WARNING

If temperature continues rising or exceeds a critical limit:

State shall change to EMERGENCY

3.2.4 Manual SOS Logic

When the SOS button is pressed:

The system shall immediately override all other states

State shall change to SOS

Emergency alert shall be triggered locally and remotely

3.2.5 Local Alerts

In WARNING / EMERGENCY / SOS states:

Buzzer shall activate

Alert LED shall turn ON

In NORMAL state:

Status LED shall indicate healthy operation

3.3 Device States
State	Description
STARTUP	Device initialization
NORMAL	All parameters within safe limits
WARNING	Potential danger detected
EMERGENCY	Critical condition detected
SOS	Manual emergency triggered
3.4 Device-to-Server Communication
3.4.1 Data Transmission

The ESP32 shall send data to the backend server at fixed intervals (e.g., every 3–5 seconds)

Data format shall be JSON over HTTP POST

Example JSON Payload:

{
  "device_id": "FF_001",
  "temperature": 42,
  "movement": "NO_MOVEMENT",
  "status": "EMERGENCY",
  "latitude": 17.385,
  "longitude": 78.486,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-08T14:30:00"
}

4. Backend (Server + Database) Requirements
4.1 Backend Responsibilities

Receive data from ESP32 devices

Validate and store incoming data

Provide APIs for the web interface

Maintain alert and event logs

4.2 API Endpoints (Minimum)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/data	Receive sensor data from device
GET	/api/latest	Get latest device status
GET	/api/history	Get historical records
GET	/api/alerts	Get emergency/SOS events
4.3 Database Requirements

Store time-stamped sensor data

Store emergency and SOS events separately

Support retrieval of latest and historical data

Example Record Structure:

{
  "device_id": "FF_001",
  "temperature": 41,
  "movement": "MOVING",
  "status": "NORMAL",
  "location": {
    "lat": 17.385,
    "lng": 78.486
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-08T14:25:00"
}
